# Logic Playground

Mathematics ought to embody absolute rigor and crystalline clarity. Yet traditional mathematical notation often falls short: its chaotic symbols and inconsistent structures force proofs to lean heavily on verbose natural language, creating barriers to both understanding and verification. This results in an enormous obstacle to the effective communication of mathematical ideas.

Traditional mathematical language suffers from two key shortcomings. First, it lacks a unified format for reasoning, making natural language indispensable for clarifying logical steps. Second, it offers no convenient and consistent way to express functions. For example, one can write $f(x) = \dots$ to define a function, but cannot simply write $f = \dots$, limiting elegant function abstraction.

Many axiomatic systems have addressed the first problem, but most are unfriendly to computer processing. The Lambda Calculus offers a compelling solution to the second problem with strikingly simple notation. However, it behaves more like a programming language and lacks the necessary components to serve mathematical proof.

My project, Logic Playground, combines the strengths of axiomatic systems and the Lambda Calculus. It removes the Lambda Calculus’s restriction of direct computability, adds expressive symbols for relations such as “for all”, and introduces a set of inference rules for proofs. This novel language is concise and uniform, with only eight operators and three keywords.
